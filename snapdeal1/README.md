## Snapdeal Application

This React-based application delivers a seamless shopping experience with dynamic routing managed by react-router-dom. Users can browse products displayed in card format, add items to a shopping cart, and enjoy secure authentication via AuthContextProvider. It features custom navigation and static product data. Future updates will include enhanced functionalities and user experience improvements. The application’s modular design and React’s efficiency ensure smooth performance and scalability, making it an adaptable solution for evolving needs.



## Routing and Navigation:

## Dynamic Routing:
 Uses react-router-dom to manage different pages of the application, such as Home, Men’s products, Kids’ products, Login, Products, and a custom Logo page.

## Navigation Bar: 
A RoutesNavbar component provides links to various pages, allowing users to navigate through the site.

## Authentication:

## AuthContextProvider:
 Manages user authentication state using React’s Context API. It provides methods for logging in and logging out, and maintains authentication details like isLoggedin and token.

## Product Display:

## Product List: 
The Amazon component renders a list of products (imported from data.js) using the Cards component. Each product card displays an image, brand, name, rating, price, and has an "Add to Cart" button.

## Product Cards:
 Cards component is used to display individual product details and allow adding them to the cart.

## Shopping Cart:

## Cart Management: 
The Cart component displays products added to the cart, allows for modifying quantities, and calculates the total price. Users can also remove items from the cart and proceed to checkout.

## Styling and Layout:

CSS/Styled Components: Various sections of the application are styled using CSS, including the navigation bar, product listings, and cart.

## Dynamic Interaction:

Handling User Actions: The application responds to user interactions such as adding items to the cart, changing item quantities, and navigating through different pages.

##  Data Management:

Static Data Source: Products are listed from a static data.js file. This could be expanded or replaced with a dynamic data source in a more advanced version.

## Home Page:

## Banner Images:
 The Home component displays promotional banners and product highlights.

##  Product Categories:

##  Category Display: 
Placeholder for displaying different product categories.

## Potential Enhancements

##  User Authentication:
 Integrate with a backend service to handle user authentication securely.

##  Product Filtering and Sorting:

 Implement features to filter and sort products based on different criteria.
API Integration: Replace static data with dynamic API calls to fetch product information.
